## Project Overview

The assignment was to create a landing page from a design provided by The Odin Project. It didn't need to be pixel perfect (i.e. exact dimensions to the design), but should match the overall look and style.

## Process

- Created the basic HTML structure of the landing page.
- Created the basic CSS for typography, font sizing and colours.
- Created the CSS layout using flex to match as closely as possible to the design.
- Created a toggle button to switch between two different theme colours (original dark and then a pink themed colour).
- TODO:
- Refactored the CSS to make DRY.
- Added media queries to CSS to create a responsive web design for smaller devices.
- Edited :focus to match styling for keyboard only users.

### Built with

- CSS3
  - Flexbox
  - Custom properties
- HTML5
- JavaScript
- TODO:
- Desktop first responsive layout

### What I learned

I found recreating the landing page relatively easy, therefore to challenge myself I learnt how to create and switch between two different colour themes.

The toggle theme colour is done by making use of custom color properties, an input checkbox that can be toggled and JavaScript to change the CSS classes between a "dark" mode (original theme) and a "light" mode (pink theme).
